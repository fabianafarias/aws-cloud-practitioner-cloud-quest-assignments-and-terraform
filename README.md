# Replication of cloud practitioner cloud quest assignments with Terraform

## Preparation
Before start the execution of the assignments, we need to prepare our terminal, making some instalations:
- AWS Cli 
- Terraform

Also will be necessary to have an user created on AWS with the access key that should be configured on terminal; and adding administrative permissions to make changes on platform through the AWS Cli. 

## 1 - Core Security Concepts
### Problem
Help improve security at the cityâ€™s stock exchange by ensuring that support engineers can perform only authorized actions.

- Create a user, then attach to the group membership.
### AWS Services
- AWS Identity and Access Management(IAM)

- Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)
### Goals
- Identify the IAM creation process and the difference between IAM users, roles and groups.
- Determine the structure and components of IAM policies.
- Identify the AWS Shared responsibility Model and compliance programs.
